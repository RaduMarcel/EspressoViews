# EspressoViews


- EspressoViews is a standalone Java tool for reporting and analysis of data stored on relational databases (RDBMS).

- EspressoViews merges the results of many SQL statements and displays them in a data tree, which can be expanded and collapsed by the user. 

- It connects a theoretically unlimited number SQLs to a report as simple as adding phrases to a text.

### How to generate an Espresso Views Report 

You should first [read how to define an EspressoViews report][ReportDef] and then follow [the few syntax rules needed to create a report definiton XML file][ReportSyntax]. And finally you connect to a database server using EspressoViews and you let the tool process your report defintion file.

### What is required to give it a try? 

You need to have the Java Runtime installed installed on your machine. The plain report code requiers the version 1.7. But the provided the JDBC drivers, which are used to connect with the database server, require at least Java 1.8. You can replace the provided JDBC driver packages with older versions if you have to stick with the version 1.7 (see further down information how to replace the JDBC driver packages).

To check the version of your Java Runtime type in the command line:
```
java -version
```
If the version is lower than 1.8 or your system does not have Java then please download and install a newer Java version (https://java.com/de/download/). 
If you know that you have the right version but the Java executable was not found from the command line, then make sure the Java PATH system variable is set correctly (see more: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).


Then download the EspressoViews file `EspressoViews.zip` and unpack it in an own folder. The application is started either by double-klicking Java runnable file `EspressoViews.jar` or by typing in the command line 
```
java -jar EspressoViews.jar
```

If the application has started correctly, then you should be able to see this database log-in dialog:

As of now this tool supports Oracle and MySQL.

Now, to use and generate an EspressoViews report you need:

**1. An XML report definition file.**

This definition file is made of your SQLs queries and of instructions, which specify how to organize and display the data retrieved with these SQL queries. To see how such an EspressoViews definition is created please read first [these introductory words on how to define an Espresso Views report][ReportDef] and then [the XML report definition syntax][ReportSyntax]

[ReportDef]: https://github.com/RaduMarcel/EspressoViews-/wiki/3.-Defining-an-EspressoViews-report
[ReportSyntax]: https://github.com/RaduMarcel/EspressoViews-/wiki/4.-The-XML-report-definition-syntax

**2. The connection credentials for the (Oracle or MySQL) database server where the report definition file should be ran.**

The `EspressoViews.zip` file contains the JDBC driver packages for the suported database server. They are placed in the folder `EspressoViews_lib`. The provided JDBC diver for Oracle databases works at least with the Oracle Versions between 12.1 and 21.1 and the JDBC driver for MySQL databases works at least with the MySQL versions 5.6, 5.7 and 8.0
These drivers can be also downloaded in internet and you should do so if the version provided is not compatible with the database system version you try to access.
If you replace the JDBC driver packages then make sure the new driver file name is also referenced in the path defintion in MANIFEST.MF file of the `EspressoViews.jar` package.  


**3. Press the OK Button on the bottom to generate the report**
